## Scene 3 – Fortress Interior & Puzzle

**Setting:** Flickering lights, alarms, control panels.

**Narrator (Sea):** Inside the fortress… a maze of traps and tech puzzles.

**Ola:** These traps will slow them for sure.

**Proud:** Yeah, they're never getting past this room.

**Eve:** Keep the alarms running. They'll panic.

**Tintin:** Jma better be okay outside I hope…

**Suepao:** This lock isn't normal. Feels like alien tech.

**Anna:** Let me see… okay, I can reroute power but it's risky.

**Alley:** Don't step forward—pressure plates everywhere.

**Tanwar:** Everyone stay behind me.

**Jacob:** I'll map the system—give me a second.

**Ichi:** Good, guide us around the traps.

**Puma:** I'll keep watch behind us.

**Punn:** Energy levels rising again… something's waking up.

**Phu:** Yeah bro these panels are about to blow.

**Shino:** Want me to disable the left corner? Looks unstable.

**Weingping:** If the system has voice control, I might be able to calm it.

**Suepao:** Alright team — on three.

**Everyone:** Three… two… one—

*[Lights boom, alarms shut down.]*

**Suepao:** We did it.

**Anna:** Power rerouted successfully.

**Jacob:** Path is open!

**Narrator (Titan):** Their teamwork unlocks the final door.
